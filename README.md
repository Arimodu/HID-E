# HID-E
This is a little utility program (originally a batch, shellscript and C mashup script) to help with my job.

**I got fired**, not because of the script, but because downsizing. 

This is here to serve other employees doing the same job, just like it helped me, it can help them. 

Also issues, feature requests, etc will be accepted, at least when I have time...

Hope it serves well to anybody using it for whatever reason you may use it.
